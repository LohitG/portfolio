                        <h2>Field Trips</h2>
                        <h3>Patriot Jet Team</h3>
                        <p style = "font-size: 1.25em">
On December 6, 2017, I went to the Patriot Jet team Hangar for an educational visit. I was shown multiple planes such as the MIG-17F and the L-39. Michael, a member of the Patriot Jet Team, showed us multiple features of each plane and told us what they did. The MIG-17F, a Soviet product, had a engine behind the cockpit in order to have a center of gravity and had bent wings for less drag. The L-39 was a trainer plane from the 1980s that needed had an air intake on the top in order to avoid duct intake. I also found out that wings that were at a 90 degree angle with the body caused the plane to be slower while giving more control. A plane with the wings bent back would go faster. We also learned about electrical planes and the current inefficiency of batteries. We concluded the presentation by learning about advances in space and the infusion of robotics into space, medicine, and the sea. The leading space tech companies include Space X, Boeing, Sierra Nevada, and JP AeroSpace. They are all trying to make space travel cheaper and more accessible. The most memorable part of the trip was flight simulators, which we were allowed to use after the presentation.

                        <h3>GoFly</h3>
                        <p style = "font-size: 1.25em">
                            On February 29, 2020, I went to the the first ever annual GoFly competition. The competition consisted of teams from all over the world who hoped to exhibit their personal flyer vehicle and earn some of the 2 million dollars available in prizes. While almost every team had a feature that differentiated them from the rest of the pack, there were two main designs that seemed to be constant throughout all of the teams. The first design was the quadcopter. In essence, this design was a glorified drone. It used the same design as a drone, with a passenger seat in the center surrounded by horizontally placed propellers. While this design was simple and effective, it was very inefficient over long distances. This was due to the ground-facing propellers. This design allowed for quick and easy takeoff and landing but was inefficient for traveling horizontally in the air. The second design was built for efficient horizontal movement. Teams with this design either created a sophisticated jetpack or a shaceshuttle-esque vehicle. These designs all had the propellers vertically placed when the flyer was flying horizontally, increasing the efficiency over long distances. However the problem with this design was ensuring safe and reliable takeoff and landing. I believe that the second design has more potential, but the first design is more reliable today. While the teams could not fly their vehicles due to horrid wind conditions, it was a great experience meeting the various teams and celebrating their progress.

<h2>Guest Speakers</h2>
<h3>Maynard Holliday</h3>
<p style = "font-size: 1.25em">On September 1, 2017, Maynard Holliday came to our POE class to give a presentation on what he did. He was very accomplished, having studied at Stanford and Carnegie Melon and working as a Senior Technical Advisor to the 44th president of the USA. He then told us about Chernobyl. Chernobyl was an advanced USSR nuclear power plant that had a meltdown when the core had a meltdown during a safety drill. It was so devastating that it may have lead to the dissolution of the USSR. In order to contain the radiation, a dome was built around the plant. Holliday went to Chernobyl to help with the construction of the dome. Engineers made a older Mars Rover radioactive-proof so that it could scout out radioactive areas. He also explained to us that even though there was a language barrier between American and Russian engineers, they were still able to understand the same formulas and numbers. On interesting fact that I learnt was that the US had a technological advantage over the USSR because they focused on using advanced technology over quantity, which allowed them to build smaller atomic bombs with more stealth. It was very interesting learning about Hollidayâ€™s experiences and it really opening my eyes to the possibility of becoming a nuclear engineer.

                        <h3>Jason Yosinski</h3>
                        <p style = "font-size: 1.25em"> In my AP Computer Science Applications class, we were given a presentation by Machine Learning Researcher Jason Yosinski. Mr. Yosinski majored in engineering at Caltech and received his PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University. While completing his PhD at Cornell, he worked as a Research Intern at Google and as a Research Scientist at Geometric Intelligence. Mr. Yosinski currently works as a Research Scientist at Uber AI Labs and was actually one of their co-founders. His team works on fundamental Deep Learning Research, trying to show how neural networks learn and represent information and how they break and behave in unexpected ways. In his presentation to our class, Jason Yosinski demonstrated an application of deep learning and computer vision. He showed us a simple program that was trained to recognize different images. The program was first trained with "test" images. Using these images the program trained itself to recognize objects such as a car, a bus, or even a banana. Then, new images were fed to the program. These images were of the same object as the test images but they were taken at a different angle and with different lighting. The program began determining what object was shown in each image. For the first few images, the teacher, or whoever was running the program, had to let the program know if it was making the correct classifications. Soon, the program was able to confidently and accurately classify the images with their objects. Initially, I didn't know which field of computer science I wanted to pursue. But after this presentation I realized that I wanted to do something related to Artificial Intelligence, whether it was Machine Learning or something more applied like Data Science.</p>
                        <h2>Mentorship Program</h2>
                        <p style = "font-size: 1.25em">In the 11th grade, I took part of the mentorship program, one of the many benefits of the Engineering Academy. Based on my interests, I was assigned to the mentor David Wang. David had graduated from UCSB with a degree in computer science in 2017 and had recently began working at Workday as a Software Application Engineer. A major portion of the mentorship program involved discussing college applications as well as how to budget for college and during college. Our counselor, Mrs. Halket, covered the different types of colleges and the major differences between public and private schools. We learned about the various types of federal loans as well as the different types of scholarships and grants that we were eligible for. In fact we were even given exclusive access to certain scholarships. After covering colleges, we moved on to building a resume. David showed me a copy of his resume and helped me rebuild my resume. Then, using this resume, I had a mock interview with David, where I practiced having the proper interview etiquette. We then were walked through setting up a LinkedIn and taught how to increase our chances of obtaining an internship. We then learned how to deliver an elevator pitch as sometimes that's all the time you have to make an impression. We then had a networking event where I met with various mentors who spanned across multiple engineering disciplines. The mentorship program ended with information on investing, including a lecture on the different types of stocks as well as overall investment tips. The mentorship program as a whole taught many important life skills that students generally don't learn in school and it provided me with a great mentor in Davis Wang, one who I know I can always count on to support me.s</p>
