                        <h3>Patriot Jet Team</h3>
                        <p>
On December 6, 2017, I went to the Patriot Jet team Hangar for an educational visit. I was shown multiple planes such as the MIG-17F and the L-39. Michael, a member of the Patriot Jet Team, showed us multiple features of each plane and told us what they did. The MIG-17F, a Soviet product, had a engine behind the cockpit in order to have a center of gravity and had bent wings for less drag. The L-39 was a trainer plane from the 1980s that needed had an air intake on the top in order to avoid duct intake. I also found out that wings that were at a 90 degree angle with the body caused the plane to be slower while giving more control. A plane with the wings bent back would go faster. We also learned about electrical planes and the current inefficiency of batteries. We concluded the presentation by learning about advances in space and the infusion of robotics into space, medicine, and the sea. The leading space tech companies include Space X, Boeing, Sierra Nevada, and JP AeroSpace. They are all trying to make space travel cheaper and more accessible. The most memorable part of the trip was flight simulators, which we were allowed to use after the presentation.

<h3>Maynard Holliday</h3> 
<p>On September 1, 2017, Maynard Holliday came to our POE class to give a presentation on what he did. He was very accomplished, having studied at Stanford and Carnegie-Mellie and working as a Senior Technical Advisor to the 44th president of the USA. He then told us about Chernobyl. Chernobyl was an advanced USSR nuclear power plant that had a meltdown when the core had a meltdown during a safety drill. It was so devastating that it may have lead to the dissolution of the USSR. In order to contain the radiation, a dome was built around the plant. Holliday went to Chernobyl to help with the construction of the dome. Engineers made a older Mars Rover radioactive-proof so that it could scout out radioactive areas. He also explained to us that even though there was a language barrier between American and Russian engineers, they were still able to understand the same formulas and numbers. On interesting fact that I learnt was that the US had a technological advantage over the USSR because they focused on using advanced technology over quantity, which allowed them to build smaller atomic bombs with more stealth. It was very interesting learning about Hollidayâ€™s experiences and it really opening my eyes to the possibility of becoming a nuclear engineer.
