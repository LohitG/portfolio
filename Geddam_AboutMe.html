                        <p>My name is Lohit Geddam. I am a Senior at Dublin High School. I live in Dublin with my family.
                        I enjoy playing tennis and chess. I also love watching football, with my favorite team being the Cowboys.
                        In my recent years, I have done robotics, varying in levels from the First Lego League to VEX EDR. My goal is to become
                        either a data scientist or a business analyst. In order to do so, I plan on going to prestigious university such as UC Berkeley or UT Austin.
                        I want to do my Master's as soon as I do my Baccalaureate. After successfully getting both of my degrees,
                        I want to pursue a long and prosperous career in whatever profession it is I choose to do. In order to prepare myself for these profesions,
                        I have taken rigorous course such as Computer Science Engineering, AP Statistics, and Principles of Engineering. In these classes, I enjoyed
                        coding miniature games as well as learning more about how data is stored and transferred through the internet. I also was excited to learn
                        how to analyze data. I know that whether I become a businessman, a data scientist, or a different type of engineer, I know that I will enjoy what I do.
