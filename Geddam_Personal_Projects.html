                <h3>First Lego League</h3>
                <div class="col-md-7"> 
                    <p>I have competed in the First Lego League two times. These two times occured during my seventh and eight grade years. In my first year, I worked with peers a year younger than me and played the role of their mentor. Having used NXT technology the year before, I was experienced in the programming and building of the robot. After a fantastic year, we went to a nearby qualifier, where we won the robot performance award. However, becuase we dedicated all of our time in our robots, we did poorly in our Core Values section and were not allowed to move on. In my opinion, my second year was much better. In my second year, I was building and coding amongst people of my age, but more importantly, I was tinkering with my friends. We had a lot of fun and had a good season. We were a few points shy of the robot performance award, but becuase we also but some quality time into our Core Values and our Project, we were still able to advance. The regionals in Sacremento was the highlight of FLL. It was huge with teams coming in from all over the state. Though we went home empty-handed, the experience we gained was priceless. </p>
