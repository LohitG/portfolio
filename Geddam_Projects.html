                <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-5 pull-left"> 
                    <p> In project 2.3.2 Bridge Design, I was assigned to design a stable, cost efficient bridge for our hypothetical client, American Bridge Company.
                    I completed this project with my classmate, Aysush Roy. As a duo, we created this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jN8hIAOKtIzvQG7diZXlp_hJXJc9zHyGrp0-W4CVayc/edit?usp=sharing" target = '_blank'>
                    Gantt Chart</a> so that we could work more time effectively. In order to make sure we completed the project to the fullest extent, we constantly referred to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wUA4a3X661x0Rf2fHAPWApLAY-sa6aNeTPlLvCenIFM/edit?usp=sharing" target = '_blank'>rubric.</a> 
                    We started the project by researching the cost and strenght differences between the different materials, cross sectional areas, and solid verus hollow members.
                    We discovered that quenched steel was the strongest and was the best material since it was not too expensive for its quality. We ended up using this material in our bridge.
                    The cross sectional area gave more strenght as it was increased, but increasing the area dramatically increased the price. We knew that the area may be situational among members.
                    In our research, we also identified that solid bars could take tension the better than compression while hollow bars did exactly the opposite. We then brainstormed two ideas each and discussed them. 
                    We found that the Warren bridge had the most stability and value so we chose it to improve on. We then shared our design with the class and looked at our peers' bridges.

                    <p>The 1.1.6 Compound Machine was the first project of POE. The goal of the project was to incorporate four different types
                    of simple machines that worked together in order to to accomplish a task. The main constraint was that only one source of human 
                    force could be applied. There was an intial brainstorming session in which each group member drew up their own ideas. We then 
                    shared ur ideas with one and another before coming to a joint agreement on a machine what would mark papers. I was named the project 
                    manager so I assigned roles and created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tu8JAcpz9zHE4HhMTrZLCrLGEMpNaNY6amyCIRZVieU/edit#gid=0" target = '_blank'>
                    Gantt Chart</a> so that we would know when things needed to be done by so that we would have a smooth project. However when things went wrong,
                    improvisation was needed so the Gantt chart was not followed exactly. It still served its purpose of providing guidlines. All of our modifications 
                    were recorded in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GiJA0g3V2x6gY5u6QgQuGcTw-AIKCO2GexR_kTpKtNY/edit" target = '_blank'>documentation</a>, which was
                    built to the requirements of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qg-jc2oqEGq-x1NHuA-q8fyHJjjVYFLck1-pbNm-QPU/edit" target = '_blank'>rubric</a>. It was an 
                    overall success and as well as a project I enjoyed very much.

                <h3>MIT App Inventor Project</h3>
                <h5>Computer Science Engineering</h5>
                <div class="col-md-6"> 
                    <p>The MIT App Inventor project was my second project in CSE. In this project, we were instructed to select a base app 
                    that we would later build upon. To get ourselves familiarized with MIT App Inventor, we did a few activities in which we
                    were able to get to acknowledge the numerous functionalities that were offered to us by MIT App Inventor. After much
                    thought, my partner and I chose an app that automated text messages for you, making it so that you do not need to reply to
                    messages when your busy. It also read out the text. But this was all the base app gave us. We did a lot more than that. 
                    Afterwe finished our base app, we brainstormed and got peer feedback very similar to my previous Scratch Project. We had
                    many ideas on what to do and in the end me were able to accomplish all of them. We started off my make the User Interface
                    much better. Now it was much more pleasant to the eye. Furthermore, we made it so that our app replies to calls as well as
                    texts. Additionally, we added a voice recognizer that converted what you said into a text. Finally, after much debate we
                    also added a transalator that could transalate your text into seven different languages. Developing the app was a great
                    experience,especially when we were able to see it in action.

                <div class="col-md-6"> 
                    <p>The Scratch project was my first project in CSE. We were the given the task of creating a game or a story with a 
                    pre-determined partner. We were told to first go through a brainstorming stage. Our ideas from this session were discussed
                    with the partners next to us. Here we were able to see the strenghts and weaknesses of our ideas. After some thought, we
                    decided on "The Princess and the Dragon," an interactive story. We split up the work and had an idea on what our beta
                    version should look like. After the beta walk, we used the feedback that we got and created a final version that both of   
                    us were happy with. It was great team effort with an even better result.
