                <div class="col-md-6"> 
                    <p>The Text Adventure Project was my third project in CSE. We had to make a interactive story, similar to my Scratch 
                    project. Except in this project, only text was allowed since we were using python to code the project. Just like our other
                    projects, we had a brainstorming session in which we came up with different themes and stories to use in our project. Very
                    identical to our Scratch project. After considering our ideas, we narrowed the choices down to two and requested advice
                    from our peers. After considering their input, we decided to go with a hijack theme for our story. We split up the
                    programming evenly so that I coded one story line and he coded the other story line. When the story lines mixed, we 
                    collaborated together and finished the project. Once our content was finished, we tried to add a feature that would let you
                    redo a decision is you typed in something invalid. While did manage a replay button, we were not able to implement our original
                    improvement. Our overall work ethic was impressive and we were able to achieve a great deal together.

                <h3>MIT App Inventor Project</h3>
                <h5>Computer Science Engineering</h5>
                <div class="col-md-6"> 
                    <p>The MIT App Inventor project was my second project in CSE. In this project, we were instructed to select a base app 
                    that we would later build upon. To get ourselves familiarized with MIT App Inventor, we did a few activities in which we
                    were able to get to acknowledge the numerous functionalities that were offered to us by MIT App Inventor. After much
                    thought, my partner and I chose an app that automated text messages for you, making it so that you do not need to reply to
                    messages when your busy. It also read out teh text. But this was all the base app gave us. We did a lot more than that. 
                    Afterwe finished our base app, we brainstormed and got peer feedback very similar to my previous Scratch Project. We had
                    many ideas on what to do and in the end me were able to accomplish all of them. We started off my make the User Interface
                    much better. Now it was much more pleasant to the eye. Furthermore, we made it so that our app replies to calls as well as
                    texts. Additionally, we added a voice recognizer that converted what you said into a text. Finally, after much debate we
                    also added a transalator that could transalate your text into seven different languages. Developing the app was a great
                    experience,especially when we were able to see it in action.

                <div class="col-md-6"> 
                    <p>The Scratch project was my first project in CSE. We were the given the task of creating a game or a story with a 
                    pre-determined partner. We were told to first go through a brainstorming stage. Our ideas from this session were discussed
                    with the partners next to us. Here we were able to see the strenghts and weaknesses of our ideas. After some thought, we
                    decided on "The Princess and the Dragon," an interactive story. We split up the work and had an idea on what our beta
                    version should look like. After the beta walk, we used the feedback that we got and created a final version that both of   
                    us were happy with. It was great team effort with an even better result.
