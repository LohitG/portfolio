                        In AP Computer Science Applications, we were assigned a fourth quarter project. Our task was to
                        create a single player card game. This theme was based on our assignments, which had been based on
                        card games and artificial intelligence algorithms. We could base our project on a variety of card games,
                        but Black Jack and Solitaire were the highly recommended ones. We decided to do our project on Black
                        Jack because we had a good amount of experience with Black Jack and it seemed easier to implement a
                        game based on Black Jack. The hardest part of the project was implementing the Ace's ability to act
                        as a 1 or a 11. However we realized that if the total was under 21, both the user would want it to be an 11,
                        but when their total was over 21, they would want it to be a 1. Using this information, we implemented a simple
                        conditional that automatically changed the value of the Ace for both the player and the computer. We were not
                        able to add additional features but we were able to gracefully implement the features of starting a new game, asking
                        the dealer for another card, and "standing", which meant the player was ready to best the dealer's total.

                        For our Quarter 3 project in AP Computer Science Applications, we were assigned with the task
                        of making a mobile application that used elements learned in class such as a database, automation, or initialization.
                        We were allowed to choose the language that would be used for the application. Android Studio, where we did most of
                        our assignments, was a popular IDE among our peers, as they chose to program in Java. However due to the unnecessary
                        complication of Android Studio, our team opted to program in React Native. MessageHelper was meant to help people
                        receive and reply to texts while they were busy or incapable. MessageHelper utilized speech to text and text to speech in
                        order to achieve this. We wanted to be able to store user preferences and allow users to create accounts but we didn't know
                        which database service to use. After much research, it was found that Google's FireBase was the easiest to implement. Using FireBase, each user was able to have their own specialized account. We were able to set up
                        an automation that allowed new users to create new accounts. This project was largely built off of my previous CSE Project, which can be seen below.

                    I completed this project with my classmate, Ayush Roy. As a duo, we created this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jN8hIAOKtIzvQG7diZXlp_hJXJc9zHyGrp0-W4CVayc/edit?usp=sharing" target = '_blank'>
                    Gantt Chart</a> so that we could work more time effectively. In order to make sure we completed the project to the fullest extent, we constantly referred to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wUA4a3X661x0Rf2fHAPWApLAY-sa6aNeTPlLvCenIFM/edit?usp=sharing" target = '_blank'>rubric.</a>
                    We started the project by researching the cost and strength differences between the different materials, cross sectional areas, and solid verus hollow members.
                    We discovered that quenched steel was the strongest and was the best material since it was not too expensive for its quality. We ended up using this material in our bridge.
                    The cross sectional area gave more strength as it was increased, but increasing the area dramatically increased the price. We knew that the area may be situational among members.
                    In our research, we also identified that solid bars could take tension the better than compression while hollow bars did exactly the opposite. We then brainstormed two ideas each and discussed them.
                    We found that the Warren bridge had the most stability and value so we chose it to improve on. We then shared our design with the class and looked at our peers' bridges.

                    <p style = "font-size: 1.25em">The 1.1.6 Compound Machine was the first project of POE. The goal of the project was to incorporate four different types
                    of simple machines that worked together in order to to accomplish a task. The main constraint was that only one source of human
                    force could be applied. There was an intial brainstorming session in which each group member drew up their own ideas. We then
                    shared ur ideas with one and another before coming to a joint agreement on a machine what would mark papers. I was named the project
                    manager so I assigned roles and created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tu8JAcpz9zHE4HhMTrZLCrLGEMpNaNY6amyCIRZVieU/edit#gid=0" target = '_blank'>

                    improvisation was needed so the Gantt chart was not followed exactly. It still served its purpose of providing guidlines. All of our modifications
                    were recorded in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GiJA0g3V2x6gY5u6QgQuGcTw-AIKCO2GexR_kTpKtNY/edit" target = '_blank'>documentation</a>, which was

                    <p style = "font-size: 1.25em">The MIT App Inventor project was my second project in CSE. In this project, we were instructed to select a base app
                    that we would later build upon. To get ourselves familiarized with MIT App Inventor, we did a few activities in which we
                    were able to get to acknowledge the numerous functionalities that were offered to us by MIT App Inventor. After much
                    thought, my partner and I chose an app that automated text messages for you, making it so that you do not need to reply to
                    messages when your busy. It also read out the text. But this was all the base app gave us. We did a lot more than that.
                    Afterwe finished our base app, we brainstormed and got peer feedback very similar to my previous Scratch Project. We had
                    many ideas on what to do and in the end me were able to accomplish all of them. We started off my make the User Interface
                    much better. Now it was much more pleasant to the eye. Furthermore, we made it so that our app replies to calls as well as
                    texts. Additionally, we added a voice recognizer that converted what you said into a text. Finally, after much debate we
                    also added a transalator that could transalate your text into seven different languages. Developing the app was a great
                    experience,especially when we were able to see it in action.

                    with the partners next to us. Here we were able to see the strengths and weaknesses of our ideas. After some thought, we
                    decided on "The Princess and the Dragon," an interactive story. We split up the work and had an idea on what our beta
                    version should look like. After the beta walk, we used the feedback that we got and created a final version that both of
                    us were happy with. It was great team effort with an even better result.
